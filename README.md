# Caliper Analytics&reg; Sensor Certification Guide, version 1.1

The *Caliper Analytics&reg; Specification* provides a structured approach to describing, collecting and exchanging learning activity data at scale.  Establishing a common vocabulary for describing learning interactions is a central objective.  Promoting data interoperability, data sharing and data-informed decision making are also important goals.

Caliper also defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API&trade;) for marshalling and transmitting event data from instrumented applications to target endpoints for storage, analysis and use.

This document is the certification guide for Caliper [Sensors](#sensorDef).  The Caliper Working Group plans to add endpoint certification in forthcoming releases of the specification.

## Document markup
